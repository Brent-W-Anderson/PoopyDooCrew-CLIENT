## IMPORTANT PROJECT INFORMATION:

### IMPORTANT INFO:

- "generate-types": "typed-scss-modules src --watch > nul 2>&1" // This script
  can have the "> nul 2>&1" removed (this silences logging when generating .scss
  file types) once vite upgrades to v7+ -- currently this is throwing a
  deprecation error for the legacy-js-api which won't be the default once vite
  is on v7+.
